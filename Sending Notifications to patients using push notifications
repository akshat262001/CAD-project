Workflow: - 
The doctor provides feedback in the form of a record in DynamoDB.
The Lambda function is triggered by a DynamoDB stream, reads the feedback, and retrieves the relevant patient information from DynamoDB.
The Lambda function formats the push notification using the patient information and the doctor feedback, and sends the notification to the relevant patient via SNS.
The patient receives the push notification on their mobile app.
This architecture provides a scalable, secure, and highly available solution for sending notifications to patients based on doctor feedback.
